# NUS-CS-Freshman-AwesomeList
Awesome list for NUS CS students to read ahead or supplement for specific mods.
Includes tips that I found useful and my grades to support the accuracy of my advice

# Year 1
## Semester 1
### Introduction to CS in general
- Algorithms, Panos Louridas
  - has 0 math in it, uses pseudocode, requires 0 experience to read, covers some basic algorithms till 2040
- Computer Science Distilled, Wladston Ferreira Filho
  - same as above, covers CS more generally with elements of databases, operating systems and programming language methodology thrown in

### CS1101S, A+
- Head-First JS
  - very beginner-friendly book on JS with tons of pictures and exercises, I even recommend it to Primary School students. Take your time with it, took me a month with Python experience without completing all exercises
- You don't know JS series, up till scope and closures
  - finishing this will make the second half of the semester a cake-walk because a lot of people struggle with scope and closures. I find reading this series to be of highest return on time invested of all the books on this list but requires a decent chunk of JS experience, only attempt after Head-First JS
  - Due to difficulty, expect to spend 2 weeks per book
- algorithms, Grokking
  - has many drawings and diagrams with recaps, good to read as a primer to recursion and sorting with some graph theory for CS1231S
  - not very necessary but enjoyable read
  
Hot take: I highly recommend against reading SICP ahead because I find the JS version to be very confusing to follow and reading this class in advance makes the actual lectures really boring (I actually fell asleep in the first say 4 weeks)

### CS1231s B+
- Discrete Mathematics with Application, Susanna S. Epp
  - textbook for discrete mathematics
  - can consider reading ahead because the textbook is really well-written, but ordering is different from lectures. Textbook contains additional exercises not covered in tutorials. I can guarantee you will not bother doing said exercises unless you are well-prepared and somehow ahead of schedule mid-semester
  - quite dry though and contains quite a bit of pointless flair information like origin of the proof or stories, wouldn't recommend reading ahead after the semester starts

In general I feel that key points are to do all tutorial questions as far as possible and to redo them a couple times until you can do them without any references, helped me quite a bit with my finals despite not really doing any PYP. I reckon the ideal workflow for A- is to
1) do all tutorial questions in time
2) revise tutorials as per paragraph
3) SKIM (don't bother writing anything down at this step) the night before/right before the lecture for about 10-30 minutes
4) attend the actual lecture itself (yes you can catch up at 4x speed with a browser extension and yes the pace is really slow but trust me, you won't bother watching the webcast until right before your tutorial if you are anything like me)
5) record frequently used theorem numbers in tables for easy access, consider keeping a binder of notes

also, put in effort into all graded assignments and learning probability. I died to complacency because probability was my best math topic in JC but I was too rusty and flunked assignment 2, thus B+

### MA1101R A-
- Linear Algebra Concepts and Techniques on Euclidean Space
  - textbook for the module
  - really well-written, I find the lectures to sounds exactly like the textbook
  - contains a lot of exercises, you can quote the questions in exams to skip working (I skipped a couple questions by literally writing the final answer with justification being the exercise number where I previously encountered the same question, finished the final paper with 30 minutes to spare this way albeit after skipping a couple questions)
  - very dry otherwise, personally didn't read this ahead

I kind of read ahead while doing a Coursera course on Machine Learning by Prof Andrew Ng (highly recommended) which introduced me to eigenvectors and matrices. I feel that the most important factor for doing well is consistent effort, strong willpower and having Math-obssessed friends to teach you difficult questions (thanks Wei En, Chun Wei and a bunch of other people on the linear algebra telegram group, your help was much appreciated). I would recommend watching live lectures back in 4 times speed in addition to the prerecorded webcasts or reading the textbook to access hidden theorems left out of the prerecorded lectures, in addition to asking any questions to the lecturers early. Stupid questions are entertained and surprisingly not as subject to ridicule

### MA1521 B
Honestly just get on your knees and pray as hard as possible. In case of Coronavirus online open-book tests, remember Wolfram Alpha is your best friend. Open book tests are ridiculously more difficult than closed book. For reference see AY20/21 sem 1 test papers (except midterms that was easy)

## Sem 2
Took 28 mcs at first with 2040s, 2030s, IS1103, ES2660, USP writing mod Tourism, German 1, career catalyst and USP seminar which is basically philosophy. Dropped german midway because Im pretty sure the W is inconsequential, finished career catalyst by recess week and workload was easy apart from USP writing which basically doomed any hope for free time.

MAKE SURE YOU APPLY FOR INTERNSHIPS EARLY (ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE LINKEDIN CONTACTS) AND APPLY FOR CVWO/ORBITAL ON TIME WHERE RELEVANT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ONLY TAKING INTERNSHIPS IF POSSIBLE - ORBITAL WILL SUCH TIME AWAY FROM INTERNING

### CS2030s A
- https://java-programming.mooc.fi/
  - just grind through this first, don't think too hard about it just do it. It is ok to forget stuff because you can just google it later
- Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout
  - Resource recommended online as a modern replacement to clean code
  - teaches many fundamental techniques such as SOLID albeit under new names
  - examples are somewhat tedious to follow so consider just skimming and re-referring each week
  - particularly useful in first few weeks
- Just google SOLID principles and watch youtube videos such as from Web Dev Simplified
  - particularly helpful in the first few weeks while doing proper project-style labs
I think this is one of those modules where the whole George Washington sharpen your axe before cutting the tree advice makes sense. For labs, it makes a big difference if you plan out most of the broad strokes of your project's implementation design, particularly if they are not provided for you. (for my year, the design of the box project is trivial to form from the specifications, but the first few weeks' customer simulation project benefitted a lot from a broad design ahead of time).

To design a project you can consider noting down all the methods of each class including module name, arguments and return type. Then draw arrows to show where each function is expected to be called from. Be sure to emphasise dependency-inversion principle and single responsibility principle so that refactoring will not be a headache.

Do all your recitations before attending so you dont have to spend too much time revisiting them, but consider watching the lectures at 4 times speed instead of attending and read the lecture notes on their website, especially if you read ahead such as with the mooc recommended above.

For openbook exams consider printing out the entire textbook and all your code off github. Your tuition fees are way higher than the comparatively tiny printing fees, trust me it is worthwhile to do this.

### CS2040s A-
Big oof for me, spent too much time on my USP essays and ended up studying just a few days before midterms and one DAY before finals, plus a couple late assignments and latecoming to tutorials. Basically consider coming on time for tutorials and study for your exams. Definitely put in effort into your tutorials before coming to class, budget around 2 hours as the upper bound for assignments and consider googling the answers afterwards - having a reference helps when trying to understand the TA's answers afterwards. Definitely clarify all doubts early and often and bug your TAs about it as this mod is ridiculously important for interviews. 

- Algorithm Design
  - never finished it because I kept backtracking with a perfectionist mindset, when in reality all the hard stuff was at the beginning and the easier stuff behind (stable matching isn't even taught in 2040s)
  - just skim it
- classic computer science problems in java
  - skim it but note down keywords and consider referencing back whenever you hear any terms in 2040s and 2030s such as streams
- CP4 book 1
  - skill level required is very on par with this mod and coding style from C++ is sufficiently similar to java. Makes you feel big brain
  - consider starting early as the early chapters are about miscellaneous programming language-related fundamentals rather than algorithms

### ES2660 B+
Just don't bother - the effort to reward for this module is trifling especially if you already take UTown mods. Pray you get a heckcare group with you and just smoke all the rubbish you can conjure up ONLY WHEN PROMPTED (if you look too competent I suspect the TA will be more harsh in grading you). I never heard of anyone failing the mod either and my friends who spent half the time I did with very plain standard submissions got an A.

### IS1103 C
Just do the weekly quiz and interactive segment on time. I suspect they dont care about what you put as the answers in the portal. Secret strat: look through past week answers for trends - for example the Singapore government is rarely if ever unethical and certain ethical categories are flat out never unethical due to "unconsidered stakeholders".

# Year 2
## Semester 1
### CS1101S TAing
An extremely different experience from doing the mod. Just because you can ace the mod does not mean you can teach it. I easily got away with roughly knowing 80% of the material and handwaving the rest, but obviously that doesn't really fly when teaching others.

TA at your own peril, and definitely take a lighter workload

### Japanese 4
Honestly I came into the module knowing about 75% of the material from self-study. The issue is that the remaining 25% would be too challenging to make up for to skip to Japanese 5, and I found the non-rigorous nature of my self-studies left quite a number of gaps in my knowledge (for example extended n, conditionals, passive form, kureru vs morau). 

Even with 75% knowledge and barely any time revising material, I still suffered quite a lot in this module with 2 hours of lecture, 4 hours of tutorials and about 1 hour of homework due before each tutorial. I cannot imagine dealing with this workload with 0 experience. It was fun though, teachers were very supportive and it was great being around fellow weebs

### CS3230
Not as bad as people made it out to be. My friends in USP taking the mod, who acted as my reference point, were all doing double degree with math and CS so naturally I was walking among giants. As a result I possibly set myself up to a standard higher than the average person, which culminated in me being disappointed in my 80% grade when really I was far ahead of the curve. I would say that apart from proofs, the mod is generally easier than CS2040s. After all, it's 2 hours of lecture and 1 hour of tutorial (done inclass) per week with 0 compulsory programming assignments. How much can they really expect you to know? I will say as well, it made me surprisingly interested in the math and rigour aspects of algorithms that I loathed before, and it made me genuinely want to read CLRS.

Highly recommend taking with highly-skilled friends. Look for the plain-looking pencil-thin bespectacled people at the corner of the classroom

## CS2102
Lectures were surprisingly decent given the negative reputation, project was fun (but painful with very weird and unclear specifications), generally feels much lower pressure than normal especially since they let you run your code before submission which takes a lot of uncertainty out of exams (if only more mods would do this, I hate being penalised for trivial careless mistakes), and databases generally doesnt require deep thinking as much as trial by fire.

Highly recommend taking the mod, but do pick up Chris Date's books as reference material, particularly on Normal Forms as I feel that topic not particularly taught well (the fact that tables that contain null values are not in 1NF was frustratingly left out)

## CS2103
Get friends to do the group work with. Competent ones with lower expectations in workload but high expectations in quality. We felt like we barely did anything feature-wise (I didn't do any of the optional stuff for IP), but 

## ST2334
No idea what I'm doing, get friends to help you or perish
If you are in USP do this mod with QR, but beware that QR material is only covered by ST2334 in the final weeks, AFTER QR's final exams (bruh)

## Environmental Quality
Concentrate in class when he's going through the material for real (2nd hour of class), and only goof off when he's revising content in the first hour. Feel free to request for consults
